# Qualitative Research of Online Misogyny
This repository is where our qualitative research around the topic of online
misogyny takes place. If you want to know why we make many of our decisions, 
here is the place to look.

## How this Repository Works
The wiki is used to document our research around topics and reading lists. 
Once we are ready we then compile this information into .md files. These
are can be thought of as our "current opinion" on the topic.

These "current opinions" then make their way into the project via a number of
channels. More clarity on this point to come.
